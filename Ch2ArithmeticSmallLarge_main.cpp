Chapter 2 Exercise
2.19 Arithmetic, Smallest and Largest

Write a program that inputs three integers from the keyboard
and prints the sum, average, product, smallest and largest
of these numbers. The screen dialog should appear as follows:

   Input three different integers: 13 27 14
   Sum is 54
   Average is 18
   Product is 4914
   Smallest is 13
   Largest is 27
