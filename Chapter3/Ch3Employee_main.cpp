Chapter 3 Exercise
3.14 Employee Class

Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as
data members -- a first name (type string), a last name (type string), and a monlthy
salary (type int). 

[Note: In subsequent chapters, we'll use numbers that contain decimal
points (e.g., 2.75) -- called floating-point values -- to represent dollar amounts.]

Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three data members. Provide
a set and get function for each data member. If the monthly salary is not positive,
set it to 0. 

Write a test program that demonstrates class Employee's capabilities.
Create two Employee objects and display each object's yearly salary. Then give each
Employee a 10 percent raise and display each Employee's yearly salary again.
