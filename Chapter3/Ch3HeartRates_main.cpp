 Chapter 3 Exercise
 3.16 Target Heart Rate Calculator

 Create a class called HeartRates. The class attributes should include the
 person's first name, last name and date of birth (consisting of separate
 attributes for the month, day and year of birth). Your class should have 
 a constructor that receives this data as parameters. For each attribute
 provide set and get functions. The class should also include a function
 getAge that calculates and returns the person's age (in years),
 a function getMaximumHeartRate that calculates and returns the person's
 maximum heart rate and a function getTargetHeartRate that calculate's
 and returns the person's target heart rate. Since you do not yet know
 how to obtain the current date from the computer, function getAge should 
 prompt the user to enter the current month, day and year before calculating
 the person's age. 
 
 Write an application that prompts for the person's information,
 instantiates an object of class HeartRates, and prints the information from
 that object -- including the person's first name, last name and date of birth --
 then calculates and prints the person's age (in years), maximum heart rate
 and target-heart-rate.
