# C++ Book Exercises
Practice exercises from my C++ class book.

I'm re-reading and working through the seventh edition of a C++ class book by Deitel. This is the same book I used for a couple of programming classes about nine years ago. The main purpose of re-reading and working through the book is to refresh my knowledge and programming skills, specifically with C++. To aid in my knowledge refreshment, I plan to work through the practice exercises for the twenty-two chapters presented in the book without any outside reference or help, including my old class assignments. The exercises will be uploaded as I read through the chapters and complete them. 

While working through the practice exercises, I will be limiting myself to only using the information in the current and preceding chapters in my program solutions. I feel this will help with thinking critically about program control. Limiting yourself to only using <i>if</i> statements instead of <i>if-else</i>, <i>case</i>, or <i>switch</i> statements, for example, requires a different way of thinking about the solution. I will also be using data types as they are presented, i.e. int, string, char, double, etc. The only exception to the above is the first variable which I declare, <i>ExitChar</i>, and waiting for user input before the main function return statement. I put these lines in my program solutions to keep the output window open on computers with a Windows OS. Recalling class discussions, I remember using <i>system("pause");</i> to keep the output window open, however that did not work when I tested the same program solutions on my Linux computer. To get around the operating system dependancy of <i>system("pause");</i>, I decided to declare a variable, and wait for user input right before the main function return statement. This worked! On my Windows 7 computer the output window stays open, waiting for me to enter a character, and closes when it receives valid input. And on my Linux computer the terminal output waits for me to enter a character, then it returns me back to the command prompt once it receives valid input.

<h3>Some notes about my program structure:</h3>
 <h4> main.cpp file </h4>
  <li>1. The first line is a comment with the file name, i.e. //main.cpp
  <li>2. Next is a multi line comment section consisting of chapter and exercise numbers, the name of the exercise, a description of the
     exercise, and any pertinant examples from the book's exercise description
  <li>3. Next is the #include section
  <li>4. Then the Standard library functions used in the program
  <li>5. Finally the main function, with comments about the program execution<
  
  <h4><u>class.cpp file</u></h4>
  <li>1. The first line is a comment with the file name, i.e. //Employee.cpp
  <li>2. Next is a multi line comment section
  <li>3. Next is the #include section
  <li>4. Then the Standard library functions used in the program
  <li>5. Finally the class member function definitions
  
  <h4>class.h file</h4>
  <li>1. The first line is a comment with the file name, i.e. //Date.h
  <li>2. Next is a multi line comment section
  <li>3. Then the Standard library functions used in the program (only if necessary)
  <li>4. Finally the class member function and data member declarations
