/*

Chapter 2 Exercise
2.30 Body Mass Index Calculator

Create a BMI calculator application that reads the user's weight in pounds
and height in inches, then calculates and displays the user's body mass index.
Also, the application should display the following information from the
Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health so the 
user can evaluate his/her BMI:

BMI VALUES
Underweight: less than 18.5
Normal:      between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight:  between 25 and 29.9
Obese:       30 or greater
