2.31 Car-Pool Savings Calculator

Create an application that calculates your daily driving cost, so that
you could estimate how much money could be saved by car-pooling, which
also has other advantages such as reducing carbon emissions and reducing
traffic congestion. The application should input the following information
and display the user's cost per day of driving to work.

A. Total miles driven per day
B. Cost per gallon of gasoline
C. Average miles per gallon
D. Parking fees per day
E. Tolls per day
